# Project #2. RESTful Web API with Node.js Framework

This is Project 3, RESTful Web API with Node.js Framework, in this project I created a web api to allow my private blockchain functionalities to can be consumed by several types of web clients.

## Setup project for Review.

To setup the project for review do the following:
1. Download the project.
2. Run command __npm install__ to install the project dependencies.
3. Run command __node simpleChain.js__ in the root directory to generate dummy data in the blockchain.
4. Run command __node server.js__ in the root directory to start the web server.
5. Open __http://localhost:8000/__ and read the instructions.

## What do I learned with this Project

* I was able to setup a basic RESTful Web API using Express.js.
* I was able to consume my private blockchain features through the API.
* **I had much fun**.
